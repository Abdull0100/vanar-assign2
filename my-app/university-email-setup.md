# University Email Setup for l215653@lhr.nu.edu.pk

## Option 1: Use Gmail for Sending (Recommended)

Since university emails often have restrictions, it's easier to use Gmail to send emails:

### Step 1: Set up Gmail
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate an App Password (Google Account â†’ Security â†’ App passwords)
4. Copy the 16-character password

### Step 2: Add to .env file
Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Restart your development server
2. Go to `/login` â†’ "Forgot password?"
3. Enter: l215653@lhr.nu.edu.pk
4. Check if you receive the email

## Option 2: Use University Email (Advanced)

If you want to use your university email to send emails, you'll need:

### Step 1: Contact University IT
Ask your university IT department for:
- SMTP server address
- SMTP port
- Whether SSL/TLS is required
- Any special authentication requirements

### Step 2: Add to .env file
```env
EMAIL_USER=l215653@lhr.nu.edu.pk
EMAIL_PASS=your-university-password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.lhr.nu.edu.pk  # Ask IT for correct server
EMAIL_PORT=587  # Ask IT for correct port
EMAIL_SECURE=false  # Ask IT if SSL is required
```

## Option 3: Development Mode (Current - Easiest)

If you just want to test the functionality:

### Step 1: Test Password Reset
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/login`
2. Click "Forgot password?"
3. Enter: l215653@lhr.nu.edu.pk
4. Click "Send Reset Link"
5. **Check your terminal/console** for logs like:

```
ðŸ“§ [DEV] Password reset email would be sent:
   To: l215653@lhr.nu.edu.pk
   Subject: Reset your password
   Reset URL: http://localhost:5173/reset/[token]
```

### Step 2: Use the URL
Copy the URL from your terminal and paste it in your browser to reset your password.

## Option 4: Use a Free Email Service
